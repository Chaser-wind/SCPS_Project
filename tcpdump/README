This directory contains the files necessary to extend the 3.4 version
of tcpdump (available via anonymous ftp from ftp.ee.lbl.gov) to parse
the SCPS protocols.

There are two files in this directory:  

apply_scps_tcpdump_patch
tcpdump-3.4.scps.diffs

The file "apply" is a Bourne shell script that patches the tcpdump-3.4
directory.  The other file contains the differences in a format that the
patch utility can read.

To apply the patches, you must have tcpdump-3.4 available on your 
machine.  (Note that to successfully build tcpdump-3.4, you must
acquire and build libpcap-0.4 from the same anonymous ftp site as 
above.)  You must also have a version of the GNU "patch" utility.  This
patch file has been tested with GNU's patch-2.5 distribution.

Copy the two files (the Bourne shell script and the differences file)
mentioned above to the directory that contains the tcpdump-3.4
directory.  (For example, if you have the tcpdump-3.4 directory 
in your home directory, cd to your home directory, and copy the 
cited files to your home directory.)  Then type

./apply_scps_tcpdump_patch<return>

The response from the patch utility should be 

patching file `tcpdump-3.4/patchlevel.h'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/Makefile.in'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/interface.h'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/path.h'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/print-ip.c'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/print-scpsnp.c'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/print-scpssp.c'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/print-tcp.c'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/print-udp.c'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/scpsnp.h'
patching file `tcpdump-3.4/tcpdump.c'

If you receive output that looks like the following you are probably
not using GNU's patch capability:

  Looks like a unified context diff.
File to patch: 

Now, execute the "configure" utility in the tcpdump-3.4 directory
and build tcpdump according to its existing directions.  Upon installation,
the tcpdump utility should be able to recognize SCPS options and packets.
