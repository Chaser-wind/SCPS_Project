The SCPS RI can be configured either a stand alone stack or as a transparent
transport layer gateway.  Most people are interested in the transparent
transport layer gateway (TCP PEP) as a mechanism to improve the performance
of TCP over satellite, RF and other challanged environments.

The following describes some of the documents in the distribution.

 o README.STANDALONE.STACK - provides a quick overview on how to compile
   the SCPS RI as a stand along stack.

 o README.GATEWAY.FREEBSD.DIVERT - provides a quick overview on how
   to compile the SCPS RI as a TCP PEP for the FreeBSD operating
   system using divert sockets.  NOTE this FreeBSD vesion will only
   operate as a network layer device.  Thus routing must be done external
   to the gateway.

 o README.GATAWAY.FREEBSD.TAP - provides a quick overview on how to compile
   the SCPS RI as a TCP PEP for the FreeBSD operating system using the TAP
   interface.  This method operates as a link layer spanning two
   ethernet interfaces.  This method operates as a transparent
   bridge and thus no external routing (unicast/multicast) is
   required.  This is operates more like a drop in applicance to
   an existing network.

 o README.GATEWAY.LINUX.DIVERT - provides a quick overview on how to compile
   the SCPS RI as a TCP PEP for the Linux operating system using a
   ported divert method - PLEASE DON'T USE THIS METHOD - IT IS HERE FOR
   HISTORICAL PURPOSES ONLY.

 o README.GATEWAY.LINUX.TUN - provides a quick overview on how to
   compile the SCPS RI as a TCP PEP for the Linux operating system using
   the TUN interface.  This is similar to the FreeBSD method - thus an
   routing must be done external to the gateway.

 o README.GATAWAY.LINUX.TAP - provides a quick overview on how to compile
   the SCPS RI as a TCP PEP for the Linux operating system using the TAP
   interface.  This method operates as a link layer spanning two
   ethernet interfaces.  This method operates as a transparent
   bridge and thus no external routing (unicast/multicast) is
   required.  This is operates more like a drop in applicance to
   an existing network.

 o  SCPS_UserSGuide_v2.0.pdf in the NEW_DOCS Directory -  The SCPS
    gateway user's guide.

 o  SCPS_FAQ_v1.0.PDF in the NEW_DOCS Directory -  A Frequently
    Asked Questions (FAQ) about the SCPS gateway.  If there are
    additional questions/answers please send them to me and I will
    include them.

 o  SMB_WAN_SCPS_v1.0.pdf in the NEW_DOCS Directory - This mini-white
    paper discusses the interaction issues with Microsoft's Server
    Message Block (SMB) protocol used to implement their File Sharing
    over the net and how they interact with SCPS.

Note there are some pdfs in the docs directory which describe the SCPS_RI
as a standaole stack.  These are fairly old documents and if there may
be discripencies with the documents listed above.  If so please use the
information is the documents listed above as primary.


Best Regads.
